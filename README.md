## What's Saturn Startpage?
Saturn Startpage is a fully open source, community build new-tab replacement **build with speed and user experience in mind**. Saturn was original build for myself but later on I decided to open source it.

## Features:

### Simple by design
- Everything is straight forward and gets you where you need to go quickly.

### Fast & Super lightweight
- Saturn was made with speed in mind, no useless animations or bulky code. Everything loads in a matter of seconds.

### Data? What's that
- Saturn Startpage **DOES NOT** collect any data about you. 90% of saturn is loaded locally.

## Installation on Firefox
- Installation if super easy on **firefox**, just head over to the [release page](https://github.com/mraif13/Saturn-startpage/releases)
- Download the latest version ending with a .xpi extention, it should be under assets. (ex: saturn_startpage-2.6.1.1-an+fx.xpi)
- Updates are automatically applied over the air. 

<sub>Side note: Saturn Startpage isn't dependant on Mozilla's addons store for distribution and updates making the installations process harder, this **will** change in the future.</sub>

## Installation on Chromium base browsers (currently not natively supported)
- Please head over to: [Chromium installation](https://github.com/mraif13/Saturn-startpage/blob/Chromium/info.md)

### Tech used
- HTML, CSS & Javascript. [I do have plans to move over to either react or vue sometime later this year] 

### Saturn status
- Actively developed/Side Project. But as I'm starting Univercity soon and also learning python, development has slowed down.
