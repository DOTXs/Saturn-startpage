## What's Saturn Startpage?
ü™ê Saturn is a custom startpage that was build to replace your current new-tab with a custom one. Build with speed ‚ö° and user experience üß† in mind.


## Installation 
<b>Firefox users: </b> This method will make use of the manifest.json file to build a extention for firefox instead of changing firefox config files.
  
<b>Chrome users: </b> Follow the steps <a href="#for-chromeedge-users" title="Chrome">here</a>, you don't need to build anything.

## Steps:

3. Once that's done, use the <code>web-ext build</code> command to build the extention.
