Saturn Startpage (Legacy) was a fork of <b><a href="https://gitlab.com/madsouris/startpage" target="_blank">Vannrith Startpage</a></b>

## What's Saturn Startpage?
ringed_planet Saturn is a custom startpage that was build to replace your current new-tab with a custom one. Build with speed zap and user experience brain in mind.


## Installation 
<b>Firefox: </b> Instead of changing firefox configuration files to make it open Saturn instead of the default firefox home, We're going to make use of the manifest.json file to build a extention to replace the new-tab.
  
<b>Chrome users: </b> Follow the steps <a href="#for-chromeedge-users" title="Chrome">here</a>, you don't need to build anything.

## Steps:
1. Download all the files.
2. Do your modifications.

# For Firefox users:
<br>

3. Once that's done, use the <code>web-ext build</code> command to build the extention.
(For firefox you need to build the extention and submit it to: <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/developers/" title="developerhub">Mozilla Developers Hub</a>)

<br>

# For Chrome/edge users:
<br>
<ul>
4. Open the extention page<br>
5. Enable the option called: "Developer mode"<br>
6. Click on "Load unpacked"<br>
7. Locate the saturn folder <br>
8. Click open<br>
9. Voila! Saturn has been added to your browser.<br>
  
<br>
