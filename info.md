## Installation on chromium

Before we start, sadly Saturn doesn't natively support Chromium base browsers yet, so you will have to manually redownload all the files every time a new update comes out. I do plan to write a small script that pull the latest version from github and replaces all the files, that should come relatively soon.


## Installation 
- Navigate to: https://github.com/mraif13/Saturn-startpage/tree/Chromium 
- Once that's done, click on "Code" then "Download zip"
- Once downloaded, unzip the files, head over to chrome/brave/ or anything else that's Chromium base
- Navigate to the extentions page > enable developer mode > Load unpack > Navigate to where you downloaded the files > click 'Ok' > Voilaa, Saturn should now be installed!
